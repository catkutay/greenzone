## Setup:

Download node.js and npm. I'm on a Mac, so you're gonna need to figure that out yourself, unfortunately. 

See [here](https://nodejs.org/en) for the node,js website.

Once you have node.js and npm installed, create a folder and install ionic inside of it.

Here's a [link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) to their setup guide.

Once ionic is installed, clone this repo into the folder where ionic is as a subdirectory.

For example:

If you're project folder is called `ionic` then you clone this project inside of it like this:

`ionic/greenzone`

Then, you should be able to `cd` into the folder and run `ionic serve` and it'll start a localhost server that you can 
access. Changes made will automatically update on the page it opens.
